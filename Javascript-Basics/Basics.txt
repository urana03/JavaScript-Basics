--------JavaScipt Basics--------

----Comments-----
- It is great way to deliver the end information to the user about the code we have written.
- Comments are ignored by the javascript engine.
- There are mainly to advantages of the comments:
1) To make code easy to understand.
2) To avoid unnecessary code.
- Single line comments use this (//) and multiline comments use this(/*....*/)

------Variables-----

-Local variables and Global variables.
-Name must start with (a-z)/(A-Z) or _/$ sign can be used.
- Name cannot contain numeric as a first letter in the code else it can follow.
- Variables in javascript are case sensitive means x is differnt than X.
- Local Variables: Those that are defined inside a function or block.
- Global Variables: Those that are defined outside of the block or a function.
- To define the global variables inside a function we need to use the window object foe example :- windows.value=12; .
- When we declare a variable outside a function it is added to windows object internally and we can access it using the window object also.

----------Data Types-----------

- Primitive Data types:
   String ="abc";
   Number = 100;
   Boolean= true or false;
   undefined = value not defined;
   null = value set to null or no value;
- Non-primitive(refrence) data types:
  objects = it is an instance through which we can access members
  array = group of similar values or data
  RegExp = represents regular expression

-----------Operators--------------

- Arithmetic operator = +,-,/,%,*,++,--
- Comparson Operators => ==,===,!=,!==,>,>=,<,<=
- Bitwise Operators = |,&,^,~,<<,>>,>>>
- Logical Operators = &&,||,!
- Assignment Operators => =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Special Operators :
?: - conditional operator return the value based on the condition.
, - allows multiple expression to be evaluated in single time.
delete - the property from the object.
in - checks if object hae given property.
instanceof - check the object is an instance of given type.
new - create a instance.
typeof - check type of object.
void - it discards the expresssion's return value.
yield - checks what is returend in a generator by it's iterator.

-------------If-Else Statement------------
- To check the condition is true or false and then execute some code.
- Types:
  if statement
  if else statement
  if else if statement

------------Switch Case---------------
- switch(expression){
   case value1:
   code block to be executed.
   break;
   case value 2:
   code block to be executed.
   break;
   .
   .
   .
   .
   and so on. 
}

-----------------Loops-------------------

1)For loop :- for(initialization;condition;increment)
               {
                    code to be executed;
                          }
2) while loop:- while(condition){

                                   block of code;
                                        }
3) do-while loop:- do{
                       code to execute;
                            }
                    while(condition);

4) for-in loop:- Will discuss later.

--------------Functions-------------------

- Provides code reuseability.
-Less coding i.e, make our program compact.

function functionName([argument1,arg2,arg3.....arg-n]){
    code to be executed;
}
