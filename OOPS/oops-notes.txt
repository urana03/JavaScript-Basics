------Javascript Classes------
-Javascript class contains various class members within a body including methods and constructors.

-Class Declarations: A class can be defined by using a class declaration.A class keyword is used to declare a class with any particular name.The name of the class should always start with an uppercase letter.

-Class expressions: Another way to define a class is by using a class expression.Here it is not mandatory to assign the name of the class. So the class exapmle can be named or unnamed.

Unlike the class declaration we can have one or more expression of the same name for the different classes.

---------Javascript Prortype---------

Javascript is prototype based language that facilitates the objects to acquire properties and features from one another. Here each object contains a prototype object.
-In javascript whenever the function is created it's prototype property is added the function automatically.This property is a prototype object that holds the constructor property.

-Classname.prototype.methodname

--------Constructor Method-----------
A javascript constructor method is a special type of method which is used to initialize and create an object.

    The constructor keyword is used to declare a constructor method.
    The class can contain one constructor method only.
    JavaScript allows us to use parent class constructor through super keyword.

----------JS Static Method------------
- It is method that belongs the class instead of the instance of the class.

   - The static keyword is used to declare a static method.
   - The static method can be of any name.
   - A class can contain more than one static method.
   - If we declare more than one static method with a similar name, the JavaScript      always invokes the last one.
   - The static method can be used to create utility functions.
   - We can use this keyword to call a static method within another static method.
   - We cannot use this keyword directly to call a static method within the non-static      method. In such case, we can call the static method either using the class name or      as the property of the constructor.

-----------Encapsulation-------------
- It is theprocess of binding the data(i.e variables) with the functions acting on that data. It allows us to control the data and validate it.


   - Use var keyword to make data members private.
   - Use setter methods to set the data and getter methods to get that data.

Read/Write - Here, we use setter methods to write the data and getter methods read that data.

Read Only - In this case, we use getter methods only.

Write Only - In this case, we use setter methods only.

-------------Inheritance-------------
-It helps us to create new classes on the basis of the existing classes.
-It provides flexibilty to the child class to use the methods and variables of the parent class.
- We use extends keyword for this.

**We can also use prototype approach to achive inheritance.
