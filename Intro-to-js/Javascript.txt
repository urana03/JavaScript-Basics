-----JAVASCRIPT---------
-It is basically an object-based scripting language which is light weight and cross-platform.
- It is a scripting language that follows the programming approach of C type languages.
- That approach is basically structured programming.
- It is a weakly typed language that means we need not to specify the variable type.
- Javascript is basically used for providing the extra functionality to the web page.
- We can use the java script for user validation, drop down menus and also give other dynamic functionality.
- Java script also use the concept of object oriented but use prototypes rather than the classes.
- It is a case sensitive language.
- It provides good control to users over the web browsers.
--------External Javascript File---------
- The external file provides the code  reusability because single javascript file can be used in the many html pages.
- We can create external javascript file using .js extension.
- Allows better code redability.
- The length of code is reduced hence allow time efficiency.
- It allows browser to cache the file hence the loading time is reduced.
- Helps the developer and designers to work on both html and javascript at the same time.
--------Some disadvantages------
- If some changes are done in the javascript file it will affect the dependent files.
- The stealer may download the js file and the steal the coders code.
- Browser need to make extra request to fetch the js file.
- If it is a few lines of code then better to implement the internal javascript code.
- If two files are inter dependent then the failure in one will affect the other file also.
